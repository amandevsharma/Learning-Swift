/* You can check whether one number is a multiple of another by using .isMultiple(of:). For example, i.isMultiple(of: 3).
 In this instance you need to check for 3 and 5 first because itâ€™s the most specific, then 3, then 5, and finally have an else block to handle all other numbers.
 You can either use && to check for numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, or have a nested if statement.
 You need to count from 1 through 100, so use ... rather than ..<.
